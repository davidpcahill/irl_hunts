### ⚠️ Infection Mode (Special Mechanics)
**Duration:** Variable | **Recommended for:** Exciting endgame scenarios, larger groups

Captured prey become predators! The infection spreads until all prey are converted.

**Critical Rule Changes:**
- ❌ NO ESCAPING - once infected, you're permanently a predator
- 🦠 Captured prey IMMEDIATELY become hunters
- 🎯 Game ends when ALL prey are infected OR timer expires
- 👑 Last survivor gets massive bonus

**Scoring:**
| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Infection (capture) | +50 |
| Last survivor bonus | +1000 |
| Time survived (per minute) | +10 |

**Tracker Display Shows:**
- "PREDATOR (Infector)" or "PREY (Survivor)"
- Number of remaining prey
- "INFECTED!" notification on capture

**Strategy for Prey:**
- Form alliances with other prey
- Share predator locations constantly
- Move in unpredictable patterns
- Avoid being isolated
- Know that friends may become enemies

**Strategy for Predators:**
- Coordinate to surround prey
- Target isolated individuals
- Use newly infected to reveal hiding spots
- Block escape routes systematically

---

### 📸 Photo Safari Mode
**Duration:** Variable | **Recommended for:** Photography enthusiasts, proof-based gameplay

Photographs are REQUIRED before captures are allowed.

**Critical Rule Changes:**
- 📷 Predators MUST photograph prey BEFORE capture
- 🎯 System tracks which prey each predator has photographed
- 💯 Double photo points (50 instead of 25)
- ✅ Capture only allowed if photo exists

**Scoring:**
| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Photo of target | +50 |
| Capture (after photo) | +100 |
| Escape | +75 |
| Survival bonus | +200 |

**How It Works:**
1. Predator spots prey
2. Predator uploads photo sighting via dashboard
3. System records that predator has "unlocked" that specific prey
4. Now predator can attempt capture
5. Without photo, capture is rejected!

**Tracker Display Shows:**
- "Photo Safari Mode [LIVE]"
- "PREDATOR (Snap First!)" or "PREY (Hide!)"
- Photo requirement reminders

**Strategy Tips:**
- Predators: Keep phone ready for quick snaps
- Prey: Covering face/identifying features helps
- Strategic to photo multiple prey first
- Prey can be more aggressive since photos take time
